# The Complete Solar System

For this project, I am going to try and create the complete solar system, though maybe not the asteroid belt.
I am going to try to create a completely textured and lighted Sun, all eight planets, and their moons, all orbiting correctly (if at a faster rate than in reality).
If I have time, I will also try to add user interaction to the scene, where the user can move the camera and zoom in and out.

1. Week 1: create the canvas view and the models, with persepctive projection
2. Week 2: animate using the matrix stack
3. Week 3: add textures and lighting
4. Week 4: Polish, add interaction if time permitting
