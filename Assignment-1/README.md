# Assignment 1

I quite enjoyed perusing [Experiments with Google](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/search?q=WebGL). Partially because I found its UI more intuitive than Shadertoy, but also because the vast array of projects is fascinating. Animations, image renderings, simulations, full on games. I didn't fully realise that WebGL was capable of all of this.
